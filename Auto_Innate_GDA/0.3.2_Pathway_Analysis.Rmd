# Calculate Jaccard sim for paths in GO, KEGG, and ReactomeDB
```

```{r}
# How many pathways have a sim of 0.5 or greater?

# What is the range of values and distribution
```

```{r}
# Now look at these values when you group them in innate, adapt, both, other
```

```{r}
# If the path  has more than 5 genes and makes a significant LCC, save it's name

# Calculate S_ab separation between these paths

```



## Using only GO, KEGG, and Reactome, how do gene sets of pathways between databases compare?
# if the Jaccard index is 0.5 or greater, keep those values and look at the path names
